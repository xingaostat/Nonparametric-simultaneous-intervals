Nonparametric-simultaneous-intervalsThe "larplateJune162021_github.txt" contains the R code to implement the MMB and MB methods. 

The MMB and MB methods are percentile based methods to generate nonparametric simultaneous confidence intervals.

The "larplateJune162021_github.txt" applies both MMB and MB methods on the heart data to obtain simultaneous
confidence intervals for regression coefficients.

The two files generates the simulation results presented in the Table 1, 2 and Figure 2 of the paper "On
the admissibility of nonparametric simultaneous confidence intervlas".
